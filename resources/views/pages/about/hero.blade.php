                        A cooperative is an organization owned and operated by its members for their mutual benefit. It is built on the principles of cooperation, equality, and shared responsibility. Members pool their resources to provide affordable goods and services, promote economic growth, and uplift the welfare of the community. Unlike traditional businesses, cooperatives prioritize people over profit, ensuring that success is shared among all members.
